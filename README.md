README - Student Depression Analysis Dashboard

PROJECT TITLE: Student Depression Analysis using SQL and Tableau

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project aims to explore and analyze patterns of depression among students using a structured dataset.
The goal is to derive insights through data cleaning, querying, and advanced visualization techniques to
better understand contributing factors such as academic stress, social support, sleep patterns, and more.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED:

- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – for data cleaning and preparation
- Tableau – for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations
- CSV Dataset – original source data (included)

DASHBOARD FEATURES:

The interactive Tableau dashboard contains the following key visualizations:
⦁	 Depression levels segmented by age and gender. 
⦁	 Correlation between academic stress, student count , study hours , financial stress , sleep duration and study satisfaction .
⦁	 Analysis of sleep hours vs depression scores
⦁	 Visualization of support the various fields.
